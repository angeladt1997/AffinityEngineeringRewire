# AffinityEngineeringRewire

Hi! My name is Angela Thomas, and I am working on recreating the Affinity Engineering (Dallas, TX)
Webstie! I am a recent gradaute of Thinkful's Software Engineering Program with an expansive knowledge
of full-stack development languages.

In the first stages of recreating this website, the build will only include HTML and CSS. As the project
advances, other languages will be included in as well as connect the code to APIs needed for the company
to process donations.

If you so happen to stop by this repository and have questions about my process or progress, feel free
to email me at: angeladthomas97@gmail.com!

You can find the deployed site at: https://affinity-engineering-rewire.vercel.app/
